[DONE] [08/24/01] Finish OpenGL code.
* Fix sound code.
* See if RGT will respond.
* Menus.
* Proper file loading/saving (ignore case, search certain directories) and
  config handling (~/.avp/{ge, re, ad, md, pd}/?)
* Command line options.
* CD Audio.
* Joystick support.
* Try to get demos and regular edition to work.
* See what FOX/Rebellion has to say (if anything) about redistribution of the
  demos and if its possible to create an installer for regular/gold edition
  CDs.
* Put together a workaround if RGT plan fails. Might just leave as-is.
* See if the build process can be made easier for those who download the
  source.
* Write documentation.
* Prep for a release.  Get someone who has a saner system to build binaries.
  Look into loki_setup.
* "Beta test."  Play through the game at least once starting with a clean
  install.
* Release. And the crowd goes wild.
* Fix any bugs found after previous release.
* Add networking and everything related (dedicated server, master server,
  etc.)
* Release new version. And fix bugs, and release new version, and so on.
----
* Debug, verify, and reimplant the inline functions in mathline.c to
  inline.h
